All of my mediocre HTML/CSS work is here. Most of it was a project from FreeCodeCamp's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course (Huge props to them, by the way!). 

For the Waving Tulip Penguin, most of the code (the penguin and the background) was from FreeCodeCamp. 
  The clouds and snow were taken from CodePen sources. The only addition I made was the Tulip itself and the penguin scaling when you click on it (because my humor is pretty broken).
